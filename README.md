# rowRowRevolution

## changes that need to be made before 2/22 playtest:
- [ ] music fully synced up (INCLUDING sped up / slowed down tracks)
- [ ] scoring system for accuracy
  - [ ] colliders on arrow objects
  - [ ] get radius stuff working
  - [ ] track switch every 16 bars
- [ ] save time in PlayerPrefs, end screen with prompt for hell round
- [ ] nav, menu canvas, sound fx
- [ ] basically get a working single level with one player
  - [ ] tackle problems with 2-player version if possible, but prioritize getting a working game
